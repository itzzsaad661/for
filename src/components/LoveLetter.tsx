          To My bubu,
          <br /><br />
          Five years ago, we started a journey that began with simple laughter and a friendship that felt like home. Looking at our timeline today, I am overwhelmed by how much life we have lived in such a short time. We’ve gone from "Just Friends" to "Deeply Us," and every version of us along the way has been my favorite.
          <br /><br />
          I love the way we’ve grown together. I love that you are still the person who makes me laugh at my own jokes and the person who makes the world feel soft when everything else feels loud. Whether we are walking through a crowded street or just sitting in the quiet of our room, my hand always finds yours because that is where I feel most at peace.
          <br /><br />
          Thank you for the patience you show me, the honesty we share, and the way you celebrate my smallest wins as if they were the biggest victories in the world. You’ve seen me through the highs of our "Golden Moments" and the "ups and downs" that only made us stronger.
          <br /><br />
          As the timer on this page keeps ticking, I’m reminded that every second with you is a gift. I love the life we are building—one that is slow, steady, and entirely ours. I’ll keep showing up for you, the way you’ve always shown up for me.
          <br /><br />
          I love you, forever and a day.
